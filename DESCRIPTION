Description: `nadir::super_learner()` offers improvements compared to past implementations
    of the SuperLearner algorithm including the ability to easily use random-effects 
    specified in formulas (like `y ~ (age | strata) + ...`) and construction of
    new learners is as simple as writing and passing a new function.
