Description: A functional programming based
    implementation of the super learner algorithm with an emphasis on supporting
    the use of formulas to specify learners. This approach offers several
    improvements compared to past implementations including the ability to 
    easily use random-effects specified in formulas 
    (like y ~ (age | strata) + ...) and construction of new learners is 
    as simple as writing and passing a new function. The 
    super learner algorithm was originally described in van der Laan et al.
