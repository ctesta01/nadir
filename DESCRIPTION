Description: The `nadir::super_learner()` offers a functional programming based
    implementation of the super learner algorithm with an emphasis on supporting
    use of formulas to specify learners. This approach offers several
    improvements compared to past implementations including the ability to 
    easily use random-effects specified in formulas 
    (like `y ~ (age | strata) + ...`) and construction of new learners is 
    as simple as writing and passing a new function.
