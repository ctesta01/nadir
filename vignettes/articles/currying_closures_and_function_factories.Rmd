title: "Currying, Closures, and Function Factories"
---

`R` is a functional programming language, which allows for functions to 
build and return functions just like any other return object. 

Super Learning heavily rests on the ability to _train learners_. 

We refer to functions that create and return another function as a 
_function factory_. For an extended reference, see [the Advanced R book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/function-factories.html). 

Function factories are so useful in `{nadir}` because, at their essence, 
a candidate learner needs to be able to 1) accept training data, and 2) 
produce a prediction function that can make predictions on heldout
validation data. So a typical learner in `{nadir}` looks like:

```r
lnr_lm <- function(data, formula, ...) {
  model <- stats::lm(formula = formula, data = data, ...)

  predict_from_trained_lm <- function(newdata) {
    predict(model, newdata = newdata, type = 'response')
  }
  return(predict_from_trained_lm)
}
```

Moreover, given how code-lightweight it is to write a simple learner, this makes 
it relatively easy for users to write new learners that meet their exact needs. 

If you want to implement your own learners, you just need to follow the 
following pseudocode approach: 

```r
lnr_custom <- function(data, formula, ...) {
  model <- # train your model using data, formula, ... 
  
  predict_from_model <- function(newdata) {
    return(predict(model, newdata = newdata)) # return predictions from the trained model 
    # (predictions should be a vector of predictions for each row of newdata)
  }
  return(predict_from_model)
}
```

**Note:** At present, the user needs to be careful that the models specified produce
predictions for the right outcome type (e.g., non-negative, continuous, densities, etc.). 

We refer to the returned `predict_from_model` function as a _closure_ because
the trained model is actually encapsulated inside it in order to be able to
produce predictions. A pneumonic/memory-aid that could be useful is that a 
closure _encloses_ objects (namely a trained model in our case) 
inside it to facilitate operating with its input 
to produce its output. 

Now you know about function factories and closures.  One more functional 
programming practice used in `{nadir}` is that of currying, which is closely 
related to producing a closure. 

If you are familiar with the following mathematical notation, a concise way to
describe currying is as follows: to "curry" the function $f(x, y)$ so that it
only takes an argument $x$ for some fixed $y$ is to produce the function $$x
\mapsto f_y(x).$$

Currying is perhaps most easily thought of as taking a function of several 
arguments, fixing some subset of them, and leaving the others unspecified and
thereby producing a new function that only takes the subset of arguments. 

Let's do a simple example: 

```r
f <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}

add_five <- function(x) {
  f(x, 5)
}

add_five(5)
#> [1] 10 
```

We would refer to `add_five()` as a _curried_ function. Why is this useful to 
us in `{nadir}`?  We use _currying_ to simplify the process for running 
`cv_super_learner()`. 

`{nadir}` internally produces a _curried_ version of the specified `super_learner()` 
with everything specified/fixed except for the data argument. 

This way, inside `nadir:::cv_super_learner_internal()` the curried super learner can be called 
repeatedly (syntactically easily) on different training datasets.
