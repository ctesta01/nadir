One of the central tasks of causal inference is the estimation
of average treatment effects.  There are many approaches to doing this, but one
of particular importance is that of *doubly robust estimation*. 

The following article provides example code for how to create a 
doubly robust estimator of an average treatment effect (ATE) using `nadir::super_learner()`. 

## Background 

For some useful references on doubly robust estimation, we refer

For a very informal, but introductory explanation, the StitchFix tech blog *Multithreaded* has a 
very nice article here:

  * <small> Nettiksimmons, J. & Davies, M. (2021). *Gimme a robust estimator - and make it a double!*
  <https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2021/07/23/double-robust-estimator/> </small>
  
In particular, the following paragraph from Zivich and Breskin nicely summarizes why it is important
to use a doubly robust estimator if using machine learning algorithms and/or cross-fit estimators like
those from `nadir::super_learner()`:

<blockquote> <small> The need for doubly-robust estimators with cross-fitting when using data-adaptive machine learning for nuisance
function estimation arises from two terms in the Von Mises expansion of the estimator. The first term, which is
described by an empirical process term in the expansion, can be controlled by either restricting the complexity of
the nuisance models (e.g., by requiring them to be in the Donsker class) or through cross-fitting. Because it can be
difficult or impossible to verify that a given machine learning method is in the Donsker class, cross-fitting provides
a simple and attractive alternative. The second term is the second-order remainder, and it converges to zero as
the sample size increases. For valid inference, it is desirable for this remainder term to converge as a function of
n−1/2, referred to as as root-n convergence. Convergence rates are not a computational issue, but rather a feature
of the estimator itself. Unfortunately, data-adaptive algorithms often have slower convergence rates as a result of
their flexibility. However, because the second-order remainder term of doubly-robust estimators is the product of the
approximation errors of the treatment and outcome nuisance models, doubly-robust estimators only require that the
product of the convergence rates for nuisance models be n−1/2. To summarize, cross-fitting permits the use of highly
complex nuisance models, while doubly-robust estimators permit the use of slowly converging nuisance models. Used
together, these approaches allow one to use a wide class of data-adaptive machine learning methods to estimate
causal effects. </small> </blockquote>

## Constructing an Example Dataset 

We will create a synthetic dataset in which we model the effect of an active
drug (treatment) vs. placebo (control) on a generic health outcome.
Additionally, in our simulated data, the treatment assignment mechanism to the
drug arm will not be completely random, but rather dependent on some observed
covariates (for example, age and income). This could reflect either an
observational setting where participants self-selected into the treatment arms,
or a randomized setting, but where the assignment into arms was designed by
investigators to (stochastically) rely on age and income.

sample_size <- 5000 # sample size for the simulation dataset

# the simulation dataset has the following properties: 
#   the A->Y is confounded by the L->A and L->Y pathways; 
# 
#   Y_observed is the "coarsened" or observed one of the two 
#   potential outcomes Y(0) and Y(1). 
# 
#   Y(0) and Y(1) are constructed as the output of a baseline

    L1_age = sample(x = seq(30, 50), size = sample_size, replace = TRUE),
    # household income is centered around $35,000, with a floor of $5,000 
    L2_income = rlnorm(n=sample_size, meanlog = log(30000), sdlog = log(3)) + 5000,
    
    # Treatment mechanism: logit depends on age and (log) income
    A_treatment = rbinom(
      n = sample_size,
      size = 1,
      prob = plogis(-6 + 0.6 * (L1_age - 40) + 4 * log(L2_income / 40000))
    ),
    
    # Outcome model components: baseline mu(L) and heterogeneous effect tau(L)
    mu  = 50 + 0.15 * (L1_age - 40) - 2.5 * log(L2_income / 40000),
    tau =  4 + 0.05 * (50 - L1_age) + 1.2 * log(L2_income / 40000),
  
    # Potential outcomes and observed outcome
    `Y(0)` = rnorm(sample_size, mean = mu,          sd = 1),
    `Y(1)` = rnorm(sample_size, mean = mu + tau,    sd = 1),
    Y_observed = dplyr::if_else(A_treatment == 1L, `Y(1)`, `Y(0)`)) |> 
  dplyr::select(-mu, -tau)
```

## Visualizing Confounding in the Dataset

Below we visualize how the treatment-assignment and treatment effect on the outcome 
are confounded by the age and income covariates.

Intuitively, the way to understand the problem this confounding poses to 
estimating an average treatment effect is as follows: 

  * Under a completely randomized regime, we'd like to be able to simply compare
  the treated to the placebo arm in their outcomes.
  * However, the people in the treated arm are systematically different (in a distributional
  sense) from the people in the placebo arm. They are higher in income and age, on average. 
  * As a result, any good estimator for the average treatment effect should take this systematic 
  difference into account.

  subtitle =

  theme = theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18))
) & 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 10))
```

## Determine the True Average Treatment Effect

Since the data are simulated including both poptential outcomes $Y(1)$ and $Y(0)$,
we are able to obtain the average treatment effect for this population as a
simple average of the individual treatment effects. Normally, this is not 
possible in the real world, because we cannot assign both treatment and
placebo to the same individuals in order to observe both potential outcomes.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 3
# the true average treatment effect
true_ate <- mean(df$`Y(1)` - df$`Y(0)`)
print(paste0("True ATE: ", round(true_ate, 2)))

# visualize the individual treatment effects
ggplot(df, aes(x = `Y(1)` - `Y(0)`)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = 'cadetblue', alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = true_ate, color = 'firebrick') +
  default_theme +
  xlab("Individual Treatment Effect") +
  ggtitle(
    "Histogram of the Individual Treatment Effects",
    subtitle = paste0(
      "We can only know these because this is a simulation.  The ATE is shown by the red vertical line."))
```

So this number, `r round(true_ate, 2)`, is what we're looking to estimate 
with our doubly robust code below, and without 
knowledge of `Y(1)` and `Y(0)` but instead only of `Y_observed`. 

## Fitting the Outcome and Propensity Score Models 

As a reminder, the outcome model refers to the model 
of the outcome given the treatment received and covariates, while the 
propensity score refers to the probability of receiving treatment given the covariates. 

In mathematical notation, we denote these as 

$$
m_A(L) \equiv \mathbb{E}\left[ Y \mid A, L\right], 
$$
and 
$$
\pi(L) \equiv \mathbb{P}(A = 1 \mid L).
$$

The above refer to the true outcome model and propensity score models, but 
when we estimate them from the data using an algorithm, we refer to the 
estimated models as $\hat{m}_A(L)$ and $\hat{\pi}(L)$. 

Note that in the real world, we don't get to see both $Y(1)$ and $Y(0)$ -- 
we only get to see the observed outcome, which is $Y = A Y(1) + (1-A) Y(0)$. 
As such, we'll drop the values `Y(1)` and `Y(0)` from the dataset so we
don't risk accidentally making any use of them in our estimation procedure.

```{r drop Y1 and Y0}
df <- df |> dplyr::select(-c(`Y(1)`, `Y(0)`))
```

Now we're ready to fit outcome and propensity score models to the data. 
To be as flexible as possible, we will use `nadir::super_learner()` with a 
variety of different learners.

```{r fit outcome model}
outcome_model <- super_learner(
  data = df, 
  formulas = list(
    .default = Y_observed ~ L1_age + L2_income + A_treatment,
    gam = Y_observed ~ s(L1_age, L2_income) + A_treatment),
  learners = list(
    mean = lnr_mean,
    lm = lnr_lm,
    earth = lnr_earth,
    rf = lnr_rf,
    gam = lnr_gam,
    hal = lnr_hal
    ),
  verbose = TRUE)
```

```{r fit propensity model}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
propensity_model <- super_learner(
  data = df, 
  formulas = list(
    .default = A_treatment ~ L1_age + L2_income,
    gam = A_treatment ~ s(L1_age, L2_income)),
  learners = list(
    mean = lnr_mean,
    logistic = lnr_logistic,
    rf = lnr_rf_binary,
    earth = lnr_earth,
    xgboost = lnr_xgboost,
    gam = lnr_gam,
    hal = lnr_hal),
  extra_learner_args = list(
    earth = list(glm = list(family='binomial')),
    xgboost = list(param = list(objective = 'binary:logistic')),
    gam = list(family = binomial),
    hal = list(family = 'binomial')
  ),
  outcome_type = 'binary',
  determine_super_learner_weights = determine_weights_for_binary_outcomes,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

There are fit diagnostics available 
that allow us to see which learners were favored, and how they performed:

```{r model diagnostics}
# learner weights 
round(outcome_model$learner_weights, 2)
round(propensity_model$learner_weights, 2)

# compare learners by their loss metric
compare_learners(outcome_model)
compare_learners(propensity_model)
```


## Doubly Robust Estimation and Inference 

Now that we've fit our outcome model $\hat{m}_A(L)$ and 
our propensity score model $\hat{\pi}(L)$, we can 
proceed with constructing a doubly robust 
estimate of the average treatment effect. 

The doubly robust estimator has the following form: 

$$
\hat \theta_{\text{DR}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left\{ 
\left( \hat m_1(L_i) + \frac{A_i}{\hat \pi(L_i)} (Y_i - \hat m_1(L_i))\right) - 
\left( \hat m_0(L_i) + \frac{1-A_i}{1-\hat \pi(L_i)}(Y_i - \hat m_0(L_i)) \right)
\right\}.
$$

$\hat{\theta}_{\text{DR}}$ is an asymptotically linear estimator, and 
the above representation of it can be viewed as a sample average of 
independent and identically distributed terms. The result is that 
we can use the theory of asymptotic linearity and influence functions to 
construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals.

         ")")

cat(paste0(
  "ATE Estimate: ", round(ATE_AIPW, 2), "\n",
  "Confidence Intervals: ", formatted_CI, "\n"))
```

## Conclusions

It looks like our estimate `r round(ATE_AIPW, 2)` is quite close to the true 
value, `r round(true_ate, 2)`, which is great!  Moreover, the truth easily lies within
the confidence interval produced `r formatted_CI`.

What is truly remarkable about this approach, as you can read about in the
references listed throughout this article, is that by cross-fitting our nuisance
models (as in, via `nadir::super_learner()`) and using a doubly robust
estimator, we are able to avoid problems related to the curse of dimensionality
in machine learning algorithms and are able to produce consistent estimates of causal
parameters with asymptotically valid confidence
intervals under relatively mild assumptions. 

If you want to keep going with `nadir::super_learner()` for causal inference,
natural subsequent directions are to use it with other causal parameters besides
the ATE and/or in other efficient inferential paradigms like Targeted Learning,
in a one-step estimation, or sequentially doubly robust estimation.
