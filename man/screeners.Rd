\title{Wrapping Learners with a Screener}
\description{
Screeners work off of the principle that they should take the same
arguments that a learner does and return a modified dataset and formula
in which variables that have failed to meet some threshold have been screened
out.
}
\details{
A screener can be added to a learner by using the \code{add_screener(learner, screener)}
function provided.  This returns a modified learner that implements screening based on the
data and formula passed.

So far, the screeners implemented rely on being able to call \code{model.matrix} and therefore
only support standard (generalized) linear model syntax like those mentioned in \code{?formula}.

  # examples for setting up a screened regression problem:
  #
  # users can just run a screener to see what data and formula terms pass the
  # given screener conditions:

  screened_regression_problem <- screener_cor(data = mtcars,
    formula = mpg ~ ., threshold = 0.5)
  screened_regression_problem

  screened_regression_problem2 <- screener_cor(data = mtcars,
    formula = mpg ~ ., threshold = 0.5, cor... = list(method = 'spearman'))
  screened_regression_problem2

  screened_regression_problem3 <- screener_t_test(data = mtcars,
    formula = mpg ~ ., t_statistic_threshold = 10)

  # build a new learner with screening builtin:

     learner = lnr_rf,
     screener = screener_cor_top_n,

  trained_learner <- lnr_rf_screener_top_5_cor_terms(data = mtcars, formula = mpg ~ .)
  mtcars_modified <- mtcars
  mtcars_modified['gear'] <- 1 # gear is one of the least correlated variables with mpg
  identical(trained_learner(mtcars), trained_learner(mtcars_modified))
