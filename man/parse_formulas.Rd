\item{learner_names}{The names of each of the learners passed to a super learner}

\description{
This function converts the user-input argument \code{formulas} to
\code{super_learner()} into a standardized format.  More specifically, it deals
with things like the use of a \code{.default} formula that learners assume if one
is not specified for each particular learner. The end result is a named list
of formulas, one for each learner, with names matching the learners each
formula corresponds to.
