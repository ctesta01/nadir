\usage{
lnr_glm_density(data, formula, weights, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe to train a learner / learners on.}

\item{formula}{A regression formula to use inside this learner.}

\item{weights}{Observation weights; see \code{?lm}}

\item{...}{Any extra arguments that should be passed to the internal model
for model fitting purposes.}
}
\value{
a closure (function) that produces density estimates
at the \code{newdata} given according to the fit model.
}
\description{
This is a step up from the \code{lnr_lm_density} in that it uses
a \code{glm} for the conditional mean model.
Note that this allows for specification of \code{glm} features
like \code{family = ...} in the \code{,..} arguments, and
that's the main advantage over the \code{lnr_lm_density}.
Also note that this still differs from using \code{lnr_homoskedastic_density}
with \code{mean_lnr = lnr_glm} because \code{lnr_homoscedastic_density}
uses \code{stats::density} to do kernel bandwidth smoothing
on the error distribution of the mean predictions..
