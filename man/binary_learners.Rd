\details{
The important thing to know about binary learners is that they
need to produce predictions that the outcome is \code{ == 1} or \code{TRUE}.

Also, for binary outcomes, we should make sure to use the
\code{determine_weights_for_binary_outcomes} in our calls to
\code{super_learner()} which calculates the estimated probability of the observed
outcome (either 0 or 1) and then applies the negative log loss function
afterwards. This can be done automatically by declaring \code{outcome_type = 'binary'}
in calling \code{super_learner()}

Suppose one of these is trained on some data and the fit learner is stored.
Suppose we are going to call it on \code{newdata} and \code{newdata$class} is
the outcome variable being predicting.

The important thing to know about multiclass learners is that they
produce predictions that the outcome class is equal to
\code{newdata$class} given the covariates specified in
\code{newdata}.

Similar to density estimation, we want to use
\code{determine_weights_using_neg_log_loss} in our calls to
\code{super_learner()}. This can be done automatically by declaring \code{outcome_type = 'multiclass'}
in calling \code{super_learner()}
